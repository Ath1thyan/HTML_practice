        <h2>Front-end</h2>
        <p>A front-end developer is a type of software developer who specializes in creating and designing the user interface (UI) and user experience (UX) of websites and web applications. The primary responsibility of a front-end developer is to ensure that the visual and interactive aspects of a website or application are user-friendly, aesthetically pleasing, and functionally efficient.</p>
        <p>Front-end developers work with various technologies, tools, and languages, including:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>HTML (HyperText Markup Language): The standard markup language used to create the structure and layout of web pages.</li>
            <li>CSS (Cascading Style Sheets): A stylesheet language used to control the presentation, formatting, and appearance of web pages, such as colors, fonts, and layout.</li>
            <li>JavaScript: A programming language that allows developers to add interactivity, animations, and other dynamic elements to websites and web applications.</li>
        </ol>
        <p>Front-end developers may also use libraries and frameworks, such as React, Angular, or Vue.js, to streamline their work and create more sophisticated and interactive UIs. Additionally, they often collaborate with back-end developers, who are responsible for the server-side logic and data management, to ensure seamless integration between the front-end and back-end components of a web application or website.</p>
